Forked out CAN control node from https://github.com/AbangLZU/can_control

'libcontrolcan.so' from this repo can be used for building the Single Sided Exoskeleton workspace.

Without the correct so file, we will get an error
"/usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible /home/administrator/Polylidar/SSEXO/SSEXO_ws/src/src/ssexo_robot/src/libcontrolcan.so when searching for -lcontrolcan
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcontrolcan"
